We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Stay in touch

Join us in [Slack](https://luet.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtOTQxMjcyNDQ0MDUxLWQ5ODVlNTI1MTYzNDRkYzkyYmM1YWE5YjM0NTliNDEzNmQwMTkxNDRhNDIzM2Y5NDBlOTZjZTYxYWQyNDE4YzY#/) and hang out with the community! It will be much easier to get started and take your first steps toward contributing to the project.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo you want to contribute to and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Software License of the repository
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/mocaccino/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/mocaccino/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Try to be as more descriptive as possible. When opening a new issue you will be prompted to choose between a bug or a feature request, with a small template to fill details with. Be specific!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
