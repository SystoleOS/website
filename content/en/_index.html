Beyond Gentoo.

MocaccinoOS uses [Luet](https://luet-lab.github.io/docs) as a package manager, which is completely static and fully based on containers. It comes in two variants:

* Mocaccino Micro: Musl-based Linux From Scratch using only [Luet](https://luet-lab.github.io/docs). Suited for cloud and containers, but more to come as a Desktop flavor.
* Mocaccino Desktop: Gentoo-based (former Sabayon branch) suited for Desktop environments.

MocaccinoOS uses a layered approach for system and common packages: smoother upgrades so you can focus on the things that really matter.
