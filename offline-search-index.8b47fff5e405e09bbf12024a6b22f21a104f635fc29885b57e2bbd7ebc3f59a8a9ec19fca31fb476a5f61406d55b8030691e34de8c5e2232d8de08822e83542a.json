Have a look at the official Luet docs about package building, and feel free to submit your first PR! Be sure to also read all this document to get an Idea on how things should look like.\nHow do I know which version of a package is available in the Portage tree We pin Portage versions by using packages that are shipping a version of it. This guarantees that there are no moving parts, and we can in this way provide updates as part of a development lifecycle.\nWe have an automated bot that automatically opens PR to track new version of the available Portage version. The package is available here: https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/tree/master/packages/portage. You don’t need to do it manually. Just wait for a PR from MarvinHatesOceans to pop-up, we will review it and merge it only when we decide (after proper QA) that a development lifecycle is over.\nA Portage bump happens when:\n We close a dev cycle (release, and upgrades) Security fixes  So, how do I know which package I can build? At the moment is as easy as browsing the portage git and point it at the same commit of our package.\nFor example:\ngit.hash: \"b0e157b071cb23b348acab3d596b49f66c244808\" in https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/blob/e9ae4aafead5a79d1d36630c932d907361d8c93c/packages/portage/definition.yaml#L6 tells you that we are pinning at commit b0e157b071cb23b348acab3d596b49f66c244808 of portage tree. So you can e.g. point your browser at : https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/tree/b0e157b071cb23b348acab3d596b49f66c244808\nHow do I revbump a package? (and when it’s actually needed?) By convention, we have chosen to increment the version of a package after the +, following semver notation.\nThat means, if a package version is at 1.0.0, it’s revbump version would be 1.0.0+1, and a subsequent one would be for example 1.0.0+2.\nWhen I do need to bump a package? Only when there is a new version available!\nWhen I do need to revbump a package? A Package revbump is necessary when you apply changes to build.yaml, although, it’s not always necessary, but just in few cases:\n When you change steps in the build.yaml When you change prelude in the build.yaml When you change requires in the build.yaml  What about packages depending on it? Always by convention, we have chosen to revbump manually those. Luet does support tracking automatically new package versions, but we want to make this transparent in the Git repository, so reverting changes introduced by mistakes it’s easier, and so we also rely on the caching mechanism of Luet.\nIf we don’t revbump reverse dependencies our CI would skip such changes, because we enforced this by policy.\nHow do I do that? Until https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/issues/7 is delivered, it is a manual process.\nHow do I add a useflag to a Portage package or layer? If the useflag you are going to add doesn’t have an huge impact on its dependencies (not requiring a rebuild) then it’s fine to apply at the spec-level. Otherwise it might be required to specify the useflags needed in that specific package, or on the parent layer which your package is depending on, requiring a package revbump.\nTake the layers/system-x package as an example, in the prelude steps of the package, we copy over the building container the custom useflags in the prelude steps:\n1 2 3 4 5  prelude:- cp-rfpackage.use/etc/portage/- cp-rfmake.conf/etc/portage/- cp-rfpackage.accept_keywords/etc/portage/- cp-rfpackage.license/etc/portage/  the package.use folder is actually shipped with the package spec. That approach can be used also in layers depending on system-x, with a separate set of flags. You just have to be sure to not override any useflag between layers, and to try to share as much as you can with parent layers while do you see it fit.\nHow do I split a package? A layer can be split into multiple packages, using the excludes/includes pattern which is used for example by gcc and gcc-base. This means you can safely compile packages into parent-layers, and exclude those in the final artifact which gets installed by the end-user.\nFor example, for gcc we drop the files from system-x, and we include explicitly files to the gcc package, which at that point doesn’t need to compile anything by itself. It just needs to depend on the parent layer, so all the gcc files are accessible from that container.\nIn the system-x spec, you will find something similar:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  excludes:...# GCC split- ^/etc/env.d/04gcc-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu- ^/etc/ld.so.conf.d/05gcc-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.conf- ^/etc/env.d/gcc.*- ^/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/gcc.*- ^/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.*- ^/usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.*- ^/usr/bin/c\\+\\+.*- ^/usr/bin/cc$- ^/usr/bin/cpp.*  This tells luet to exclude those files from the final artifact.\nSimilarly, you can find in the gcc package those files being included:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  includes:...- /usr/lib/gcc$- /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu$- /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/lib/go$- /usr/lib/go/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/lib64$- /usr/lib64/go$- /usr/lib64/go/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/libexec$- /usr/libexec/gcc$- /usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu$- /usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/{{.Values.version}}.*- /usr/share$- /usr/share/gcc-data$- /usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu$- /usr/share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/{{.Values.version}}.*  How do I try my changes? You need at least Docker running locally, or img installed.\nTo build a package, just edit/add the relevant specs and run PACKAGES=\"..\" make rebuild-all.\nHow can I debug the build environment? Luet generates docker images for each package, you can start a shell by either retrieving manually the docker image of the package with luet tree images and manually run docker run.. on it or you can use the luet extension which does that already for you. You need to have installed system/luet-devkit package, and you can use it as follows:\n1  DOCKER_HOST=\"...\" LUET_ARGS=\"--image-repository quay.io/mocaccinocache/desktop\" luet remote-exec packagename   Note: It’s not required DOCKER_HOST unless you want to leverage a remote host.\nOnce you are hooked into the container there are some limited tools at your disposal that might help you. For instance if you want to list all the atoms that are installed you can do:\n1  qlist -IRv   How do I add a package? Have a look at the official docs about specfile and their syntax. After you familiarize with it, you can just open up a PR, by taking as an example an already existing layer. See, for example calamares\nHow do I update provides list, and what are they? Provides are packages that your layer/package is going to satisfy. That means if other packages are depending on a package/foo, and that is provided by package/bar, package/bar will get installed in place of package/foo.\nAt the moment it’s a manual process - and we will work an automated way as soon as we have bandwidth for it. This mechanism it’s used to ensure a smooth migration path from Sabayon/Entropy based systems.\nHow do I know that a package belongs to a Layer? Packages belonging to a layer should be listed as provides, and also part of the arguments to emerge for compiling that package. Until we deliver https://github.com/mocaccinoOS/desktop/issues/6 - it is also a manual process. Refer to the section of this document “How can I debug the build environment?” to see how to hook directly into a package container to inspect its content.\nHow do I find the duplicate files in the package repositories? You can use luet search and luet filter to compose a list of duplicate files. luet 0.11.3 returns the files in the packages as part of the json result:\n1  luet search -o json | luet filter   To install luet-filter, just run:\n1  luet install -y extension/filter   Note: luet search searches into online repositories enabled in the system unless --installed is specified. You need to have the desktop repo enabled locally in order to retrieve this list.\nThe package I want to add needs a user/group. Where do I add it? The user/groups in MocaccinoOS are defined by entities. They are an uniform way to define user/groups across different distributions in a unique and interoperable way. The same users/groups are indeed shared with Mocaccino Micro.\nAll the users groups are defined in a unique collection inside the os-commons repository, here\nHow do I add a system-wide extension, or configure a gnome setting? We have a gnome-skel package for that purpose. Check the content, apply the required changes and bump the package version.\n","excerpt":"This document has the objective to address several questions that …","ref":"/docs/desktop/development/howdoi/","title":"Frequent questions"},{"body":"An AppImage is a downloadable file for Linux that contains an application and everything the application needs to run (e.g., libraries, icons, fonts, translations, etc.) that cannot be reasonably expected to be part of each target system.\nAppImages should work in MocaccinoOS as in other distributions, with no exception.

And we will assume the commands are running as root.\n1 2  $ mkdir -p /user/system_repository/tree $ cd /user/system_repository   All the commands from now on will be carried from the /user/system_repository directory.\nFirst package Let’s put our eyes on, let’s say, games-board/gnome-chess, and create a compilation definition for it.\nLet’s first declare it’s canonical name, or how you would actually install it afterwards with luet (e.g. luet install app/gnome-chess)\n1 2 3 4 5 6  $ mkdir tree/gnome-chess $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003etree/gnome-chess/definition.yaml category: \"apps\" name: \"gnome-chess\" version: \"0.1\" EOF   Here the version doesn’t really matter, it’s mostly for you to keep it track in your system. You can decide to follow strictly the versioning from gnome-chess, or not.\nNow let’s get to the important part, the build definition. This tells luet how to compile your package:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003etree/gnome-chess/build.yaml package_dir: \"/package\" steps: - emerge --root /package games-board/gnome-chess requires: - category: \"layers\" name: \"gnome\" version: \"\u003e=0\" EOF   as you see, we are using emerge here to compile the package. The requires section tells from where it runs the command, which in this case is the MocaccinoOS desktop gnome layer. To see all the layers available, run luet search layers or to see the currently installed, you can run luet search --installed layers).\nNote The package_dir option tells luet where is the final package located. We use emerge --root here to specify a different location where our package is installed. We could also drop package_dir and --root from emerge and let luet compute the delta, but in this way it’s faster and less I/O intensive.  Note Even if the example shows how to build a package with emerge, it is although possible to create packages out from any docker image - even not by compiling. You have to be careful to check if any package dependencies are actually already shipped by the layers  Now let’s add an installation hook to our package, in our specific case (gnome-chess) we need a trigger to generate glib schemas right after the package gets installed in the system:\n1 2 3 4  $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003etree/gnome-chess/finalize.yaml install: - glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas EOF   Building the package Now let’s build the packages (remember to run as root, or with sudo upfront):\n1  $ luet build --tree tree --pull --pull-repository quay.io/mocaccinocache/desktop --from-repositories --live-output --only-target-package apps/gnome-chess    Note The first time can take up some time due to downloading the images, but those are cached locally for local iteration. Time for a coffee!  After build is completed, generate the repository metadata:\n1  $ luet create-repo --tree tree   Install the package First let’s consume the repository we just created in our system:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  $ cat \u003c\u003cEOF \u003e\u003e /etc/luet/repos.conf.d/local.yaml name: \"local-repository\" description: \"Local repository\" type: \"disk\" enable: true cached: true priority: 99 urls: # Repository URLs - /user/system_repository/build EOF   Now we are ready to install gnome-chess locally:\n1  $ luet install apps/gnome-chess   Advanced topics Showing package files Luet shows already all the files shipped by a package with luet search. For example:\n1  $ luet search apps/gnome-chess -o yaml   Find duplicate files shipped by packages You can check duplicate files into the package shipped by repositories, also before installing them:\n1  luet search -o json | luet filter   This is particularly useful to check for any conflicting files with the system packages and the ones you are generating.\nSee also the dev section regarding duplicate files.\nRemoving generated docker images By default, images are tagged under luet/cache. So it’s possible to remove all the cache images generated by removing the luet/cache and quay.io/mocaccinocache/desktop images, although, you should also prune afterwards the images not referenced anymore by any tag with docker image prune:\n1 2 3  $ docker images --filter='reference=luet/cache' --format='{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}' | xargs -r docker rmi $ docker images --filter='reference=quay.io/mocaccinocache/desktop' --format='{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}' | xargs -r docker rmi $ docker image prune   A way to reclaim all the space occupied by docker more aggressively is by running docker system prune, but attention, this command will remove all the images, also the ones which weren’t generated by luet:\n1  $ docker system prune --force --volumes --all   References  Luet docs Luet Packages Luet hello world Emerge ebuild example  ","excerpt":" Warning Building packages is a complex topic.

Be sure to have installed in the system or the stable or the development repositories only.  In MocaccinoOS repositories are standard packages. To remove the development repositories, you can:\n1  $ luet uninstall -y repository/mocaccino-extra repository/mocaccino-kernel repository/mocaccino-desktop repository/mocaccino-os-commons   And then to enable the stable repositories:\n1  luet install -y repository/mocaccino-extra-stable repository/mocaccino-kernel-stable repository/mocaccino-desktop-stable repository/mocaccino-os-commons-stable   The same procedure is valid as well to switch from -stable to development repositories.\nThe difference is that you have to remove the -stable ones instead.\n","excerpt":"Development isos have the -dev suffix.
